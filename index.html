        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm a fullstack web developer who's all about unleashing
          creativity and having a blast. When I'm not busy crafting amazing
          websites and applications, you will find me indulging in my passion
          for the arts. Whether it's spray painting, dancing, 3d designing, or
          making music, I love exploring different artistic avenues to express
          my creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And speaking of exploring, games are my go-to! From board games that
          transport me to magical realms, to video games that let me conquer
          virtual worlds, and even sports that get my adrenaline pumping, I
          can't resist the allure of a good game. I thrive on the strategic
          thinking and problem-solving challenges they offer, always pushing the
          boundaries and discovering new ways to conquer the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my fullstack skills and imaginative mindset, I feel like a wizard
          of code, conjuring up innovative ideas and bringing them to life on
          the digital canvas. I'm constantly on the lookout for fresh and
          exciting projects where I can let my creativity run wild, designing
          captivating experiences that enthrall users and leave them wanting
          more.
        </p>
        <!-- <h1>Where Am I?</h1>
        <p>
          I have lived most of my life in Arizona. I love traveling through the
          United States, and have been to many of the western states. I am
          inspired whenever I come across something new. Being captivated by
          anything new is a blessing and a curse because I always find joy in
          seeing new things, but then spend most of my free time focusing on or
          learning that new thing.
        </p>
        <h1>Where Am I Going?</h1>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal in life is to continually create. Whether it be new
          friendships, programs, art, or anything, I seek to grow and become a
          better person with better skills than I had the day before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life is currently heading down a path of fullstack developer, actor,
          and artist.

          original MVP, but since has changed due to the group's requirements
          and needs.
